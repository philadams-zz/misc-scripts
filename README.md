Misc Scripts
============

Little miscellaneous scripts that are useful and used at least somewhat
frequently, but don't really have a more logical home.

- `phdupdates` Given a .csv download of the [IS PhD
  Updates](philadams.net/is-phd-updates) form, pretty-print the updates for
  `pbcopy`ing into the email body.
- `agefrombday` Given a birthdate, figure out how old that person is today.
- `git-stats-hook-add` Add a post-commit hook to the current repo so that
  [git-stats](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/git-stats)'s local db is updated
  automagically.
- `pip-home` Open the project homepage for a given [pip](https://pip.pypa.io)
  package.
